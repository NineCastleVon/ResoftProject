# Resoft Project
<daeguAI school first project => clone coding><br>
Period: July 1st to July 15th
I am a non-major who started studying coding at the late age of 34 and a student who is taking a coding learning program supported by Daegu.
I studied basic coding extensively from April to June.
The studies included html, css, javascript, python, bootstrap, react, jQuery, Azure, flask, machine Learning, Deep Learning-Computer Vision and Object Detection, Numpy, Pandas, Data Preprocessing, Keras, cloud, etc.
Of course I didn't study a lot of these things deeply.
I only studied and looked at each concept and how it was used.
Since then, I have studied html, css, and javascript. Because these are the most basic things.
Based on what I've learned, I was able to carry out projects with people in the same school.
A project that I tried for the first time.
I was able to complete it by studying through development code and Google search.
The function part was particularly difficult and would not have been completed without the help of the developer code.

1. This project is the result of cloning with team members.
