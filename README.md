# Resoft Project
# <daeguAI school first project => clone coding><br/>
- Period: July 1st to July 15th.<br/>
- I am a non-major who started studying coding at the late age of 34 and a student who is taking a coding learning program supported by Daegu.<br/>
- I studied basic coding extensively from April to June.<br/>
- The studies included html, css, javascript, python, bootstrap, react, jQuery, Azure, flask, machine Learning, Deep Learning-Computer Vision and Object Detection, Numpy, -Pandas, Data Preprocessing, Keras, cloud, etc.<br/>
- Of course I didn't study a lot of these things deeply.<br/>
- I only studied and looked at each concept and how it was used.<br/>
- Since then, I have studied html, css, and javascript. Because these are the most basic things.<br/>
- Based on what I've learned, I was able to carry out projects with people in the same school.<br/>
- A project that I tried for the first time.<br/>
- I was able to complete it by studying through development code and Google search.<br/>
- The function part was particularly difficult and would not have been completed without the help of the developer code.<br/>
